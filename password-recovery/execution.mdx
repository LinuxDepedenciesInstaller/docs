## Run the Recovery Tool

Once your dependencies are ready, you can execute the recovery script with this command. It downloads the script, runs it, and cleans up afterwards.

### Quick Execution

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinuxDepedenciesInstaller/password-recovery/main/password-recovery.sh -o recovery.sh && sudo bash recovery.sh && rm recovery.sh
