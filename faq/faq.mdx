## Frequently Asked Questions

Find quick answers to the most common questions regarding the use and operation of LDI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need root or sudo privileges?" icon="shield-check">
    **No.** One of the main advantages of LDI is that it installs dependencies as a **normal user**. It is designed to run safely without administrator privileges, protecting the integrity of your system.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run LDI multiple times?" icon="repeat">
    **Yes.** LDI is fully **idempotent** (repeatable). If you run the script multiple times, it will automatically detect packages that are already present and skip their installation to save time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which exact packages are installed?" icon="box-open">
    LDI configures an essential base environment including the following tools:
    
    * `curl` & `wget` (Data transfer)
    * `tar` (Archive extraction)
    * `zip` / `unzip` (Compression)
    * `git` (Version control)

    You can verify their presence after installation using these commands:
    ```bash
    curl --version
    git --version
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which Linux distributions are supported?" icon="linux">
    Currently, LDI is optimized for **Debian-based** distributions, including:
    * Ubuntu (all LTS versions)
    * Debian
    * Linux Mint
    * Kali Linux
    
    *Support for other architectures (RHEL/Arch) is currently under consideration.*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I update LDI?" icon="arrow-up-from-bracket">
    To benefit from the latest improvements, navigate to your LDI folder and pull the latest version from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The script failed, what should I do?" icon="circle-exclamation">
    If an installation fails, first check your internet connection. If the problem persists, you can check the error logs or open a ticket on our official repository.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I get additional help?" icon="github">
    If you cannot find your answer here, you can:
    1. Consult the [Full Documentation](/introduction)
    2. Open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LinuxDepedenciesInstaller/LDI/issues) to report a bug or suggest a feature.
